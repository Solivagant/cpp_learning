# .SURVIVORS

What started as a training exercise to re-acquaint myself with C++ became a small game I made in Raylib https://raylib.com.
.SURVIVORS is a riff on the genre kickstarted by Vampire Survivors.

It uses templates, smart pointers, threads, mutexes, maps, string streams, the service locator and object pool design patterns, and data models.
